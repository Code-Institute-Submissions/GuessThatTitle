## UX

### [**Strategy**](#strategy)

In this section, we need to develop the business goals, target audiences, and most
importantly the value our website/app will add for the user.

#### Business Goals

For a simple game like ours, business goals may include:

- Increase brand awareness
- Add a fun element to our brand
- Stand out from competitors

#### User Goals

- Have fun playing an interactive game
- Discover new movie titles to research
- Simple and easy to use interface
- Guidence on how to play if needed

#### Target Audience

We must conisder how our audience might incluence our design (both visually and technically)
Our taget audience for this app is very wide (Roughtly: 15-50). Therefore, we need to make sure our application is designed with
encorporate all users that may land on our website. To do this, we can make sure:

- We include a mixture of content that is relevant to both young and old (movies from all years)
- Our visual design is young enough not to be boring but also easily understood by an older audience
- Our app must be simple to use for all audiences

### [**Scope**](#scope)

In this section, we will discuss how features will align with our strategy. We need to identify what needs to be done, what tradeoffs we might need to make, 
and ask ourselves more about the user and their journey using our app. We will discuss the needs of the user.

#### What is the user looking for? 
Our user is in search of a fun, interactive game that they can play and share with friends. 
They want a game that is challenging but also engageing. 

 
#### What the user might not know they need? 

The user may require assistence in understanding how the game works. They might, after playing the game, 
want to get in touch with the developer. 

To address this need we can include a How To Play section and a Contact Us form where the user can email us. 

### [**Structure**](#structure)

This section is concerned with how the content of the website will be organised. It will place structure on the user 
journey and make structural decisions based on our Strategy and Scope.

### Navigation

In terms of navigation, our game we  be designed with a linear nagivation model. This allows us to control
eaxtly what the user is able to do at each stage. 
- For example: Choose Round 1 Theme -> Answer Question 1 ... Answer Quesiton 4 -> New Round -> Choose Round Two Theme ..

Our overall navigation menu will be non-linear allowing the user to switch between contact, how-to, and home pages. 

### Feedback & Safety 

The user needs to feel safe throughout the experience and receive feedback for their actions. 

To do this we can include:
- Subtle changes in the UI when interacted with (Shadow, Colour etc)
- Ensure that we provide Exit and Restart options that are available via the menu throughout the game
- Ensure that content is loaded from the API before displaying it to the user
- Audio to indicate correct answers, life loses, and game over.
